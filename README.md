I'm Augustin CHINI a French software engineer, I've been working for 3 years with AngularJs and Angular 2+ frameworks, so I choose React with TypeScript to discover this famous library, and learn something new.

You can see below some links I have found on the internet which inspired me when I was creating this website, so ... giving credit where credit is due:
